  - Reduced particle count from 1000 to 300-600 based on device capability
  - Reduced sphere count from 20 to 10-20
  - Reduced wave geometry complexity
- **FPS Limiting**: Limited FPS to 30 for low-performance devices
- **Visibility Detection**: Added Intersection Observer to pause animations when not visible
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper disposal of Three.js resources
- **Debounced Resize**: Added debounced window resize handling

### 4. Component Lazy Loading (`page.jsx`)
- **Dynamic Imports**: All major components now use dynamic imports
- **Loading States**: Added skeleton loading states for better UX
- **SSR Optimization**: Disabled SSR for heavy components like 3D background

### 5. Caching Strategy
- **API Caching**: Added 1-hour cache for external API calls
- **Service Worker**: Implemented comprehensive service worker for offline support
- **Static Asset Caching**: Cached all images, fonts, and critical resources
- **Stale-While-Revalidate**: Implemented SWR pattern for better performance

### 6. Resource Preloading
- **Critical Resources**: Preloaded profile image, fonts, and project images
- **DNS Prefetching**: Added DNS prefetch for external domains
- **Font Preloading**: Preloaded custom fonts for better performance

### 7. Performance Monitoring (`performance.js`)
- **Core Web Vitals Tracking**: Implemented LCP, FID, and CLS tracking
- **Page Load Metrics**: Track DNS, TCP, TTFB, and other performance metrics
- **Device Performance Detection**: Detect low-performance devices
- **Image Size Optimization**: Dynamic image sizing based on device capability

### 8. PWA Implementation
- **Web App Manifest**: Created comprehensive manifest for PWA support
- **Service Worker**: Full offline support with caching strategies
- **App Icons**: Multiple icon sizes for different devices
- **Theme Colors**: Proper theme color implementation

### 9. Code Splitting and Bundle Optimization
- **Dynamic Imports**: Reduced initial bundle size through code splitting
- **Tree Shaking**: Optimized imports to reduce unused code
- **Chunk Optimization**: Better chunk organization for faster loading

### 10. SEO and Meta Optimizations (`layout.tsx`)
- **Structured Data**: Added comprehensive JSON-LD structured data
- **Meta Tags**: Optimized meta tags for better SEO
- **Open Graph**: Enhanced social media sharing
- **Twitter Cards**: Optimized Twitter card implementation

## Performance Metrics Expected Improvements

### Before Optimizations:
- **Lighthouse Performance Score**: 15
- **First Contentful Paint**: ~4-6 seconds
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: ~6-8 seconds
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: High
- **First Input Delay**: High

### After Optimizations:
- **Lighthouse Performance Score**: 85-95
- **First Contentful Paint**: ~1-2 seconds
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: ~2-3 seconds
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: Low
- **First Input Delay**: Low

## Key Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Through code splitting and tree shaking
2. **Faster Image Loading**: Through optimization and lazy loading
3. **Better Caching**: Through service worker and API caching
4. **Reduced JavaScript Execution**: Through 3D background optimizations
5. **Faster Initial Load**: Through resource preloading
6. **Better Mobile Performance**: Through device-specific optimizations

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring
- Core Web Vitals tracking implemented
- Real-time performance metrics logging
- Device capability detection

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
1. Update dependencies regularly
2. Monitor Core Web Vitals
3. Optimize images as needed
4. Review and update caching strategies
5. Monitor service worker performance

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Lighthouse Testing**: Run Lighthouse audits regularly
2. **Device Testing**: Test on various devices and network conditions
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor real user metrics
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Regular bundle size analysis
5. **Image Optimization**: Regular image optimization reviews

## Future Optimizations

1. **CDN Implementation**: Consider using a CDN for static assets
2. **Advanced Caching**: Implement more sophisticated caching strategies
3. **Image Format Optimization**: Consider using more modern image formats
4. **Critical CSS Inlining**: Inline critical CSS for faster rendering
5. **Resource Hints**: Implement more resource hints for better performance

## Conclusion

These optimizations should significantly improve the Lighthouse performance score from 15 to 85-95, providing a much better user experience with faster loading times, better mobile performance, and improved Core Web Vitals scores.
